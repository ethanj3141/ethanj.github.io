		<div class = "instructions">
			<h1>Story</h1>
			<p>Control Albert, trusty steed of Spangler (of the five-sided hat). The two of you are famed in story, for great deeds . . . but those were years ago. The two of you are old and at this moment he's drunk. Drunk, that is, while traversing an area filled with horse-shaped <span class = "i">things</span>, <span class = "i">things</span> best avoided. (They kick.) Despite the passing of the years, they ought to pose no challenge. Sadly, if Albert's going to be frank, Spangler is <span class = "i">real</span> drunk. In this state, he can only reliably teleport back to Hearth-Stone of the nearest Town Square, and it's on <span class = "i">exactly</span> the wrong side of the infested vales.</p>
			
			<p>Nip past the <span class = "i">things</span>, so Spangler can get back on. Jump over fences, propelled by your riders' remaining aura of heroics! Reach the exit. (Careful, Albert is too old to gallop while carrying someone.) Continue until something spooks Spangler again. Repeat, until you reach the road.</p><!--note to self change loss text and so on appropriately-->
			
			<p>(At least this party he's been invited to usually has good horse-lodgings.)</p>

			<p>
			. . . right. How <span class = "i">does</span> one control Albert? With the arrow keys: up arrow to move up, right arrow for right, left arrow for left, and of course the right arrow to move right. The fences can be jumped once you pick up Spangler, but Albert's too old to move at anywhere near the same speed while carrying Spangler. Reach the Exit Flag to finish each level, complete all 5 levels to win. If you end up in the same spot as one of the dangerous horse-things, Spangler can teleport you to safety, but that'll force the two of you to start again from the beginning.
			</p>
			<p>Good luck.</p>
